## Overview

The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a deep learning architecture that applies the Transformer model, originally introduced for natural language processing tasks, to visual data. In this implementation, we have incorporated the crucial steps of patch extraction and positional embedding, which are essential for the proper functioning of the Vision Transformer.

The patch extraction step divides the input image into smaller patches, treating each patch as a token. This process enables the model to capture local information within the image. The positional embedding step assigns learnable embeddings to each patch, providing the model with spatial information about the patches' locations.

By combining the patch extraction, positional embedding, and self-attention mechanisms, the Vision Transformer can effectively model long-range interactions between image patches, leading to improved performance in image classification tasks.
